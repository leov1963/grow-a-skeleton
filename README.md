# Grow a Skeleton!

### All a bone needs is proper love, care, and a touch of dark energy to grow into a full grown undead skeleton buddy! Do you have what it takes to grow a bone-head friend of your very own? Even the undead need love and care to thrive!

## Motivation

I was inspired to make a tamagotchi clone but with a silly, spooky themed twist. I personally enjoy games that are cute and the tamagotchi model lends itself to that vibe. Putting a skeleton/farming theme twist is meant as a reference to both the RPG and simple farming games I've played in my childhood.

### Game Loss

- Oh no! The player lost because bones did not get the care they needed. If the thirst or hunger meters reach ten it's game over. This also happens if the dark energy depletes down to 0.
